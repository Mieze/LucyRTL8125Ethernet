 * stored and sets was_truncated to true if it is non-NULL and the backtrace was
 * truncated to fit in the provided space.  The backtrace starts at the calling
 * function.  A zero will be stored after the return addresses in the buffer,

 *
 * @param bt Clients must provide a buffer in which to store the return
 * addresses.
 *
 * @param btlen Along with the buffer, its length (in terms of uintptr_t) must
 * also be provided.
 *
 * @param was_truncated Optionally, clients can provide a boolean out-parameter
 * that will be set to true if the backtrace was truncated due to a lack of
 * buffer space.
 *
 * @return The number of return addresses written to bt is returned.  The
 * function cannot return an error.
