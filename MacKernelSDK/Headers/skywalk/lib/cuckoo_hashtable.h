 * due to the fact that typical user of a hashtable would anyway have the key
 * stored elsewhere (most often in the looked-up object).
 *
 * The cuckoo_hashtabl_node forms a singly linked list of objects that have
 * exactly the same hash value (not just hash bucket collision). This is the
 * result of not storing full length key in the table. So the caller has to
 * traverse the list to add or find the correct object.
